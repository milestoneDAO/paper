## Overview

As the name sugguest there will be milestones setup by both parties (startup and investor) consensus which is known as Proof of Agreement.
Each Milestone will have a task and certain amount of funds associated. Once the task is completed at the speculated time as promised by the startup, the funds which will be stored in an Escrow account will be released.
### if m1, m2, m3, mN... are milestone1, milestone2, milestone3, milestoneN respectively
