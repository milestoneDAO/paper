## Emergence
The idea of MilestonDAO was born on 20th Nov 2019 during [DAOfest](https://www.daofest.io/) in Kuala Lumpur

## Overview
MilestoneDAO is a Governance Model primarily used to solve the trust gap between investors and early age startups through milestone funding.
As the name suggest there will be milestones set up by both parties (startup and investor) consensus which is known as Proof of Agreement.
Each Milestone will have a task and a certain amount of funds associated. Once the task is completed at the speculated time as promised by the startup, the funds which will be stored in an escrow account will be released.
### if m1, m2, m3, mN... are milestone1, milestone2, milestone3, milestoneN respectively
### & Complete Project is P
### P = m1 + m2 + m3 + ..... + mN
      Hence all cumulative milestone is equal to a completed project

## Limitations
The governance model of MilestoneDAO is not limited to VCs and early age startups instead extend its horizon to the service provider and service consumer

## Real World Use case (example)
https://www.mcmc.gov.my/en/media/press-releases/63-compounds-totaling-rm2-32-million-issued-to-tel
MCMC is Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission, which charged telcos 2.32 Million Malaysian Ringgit (approx. $500k USD) for not able to offer services up to the mark to customers on various instances, fake registries and regulatory issues.

MilestoneDAO can save telcos lots from such fines and also make them behave in accordance with the regulations by charging them not as a whole amount at the end of the year rather setting milestones like a small sum will be charged in case there is any such breach of regulations.
The breaches will be identified by a third party escrow or even by data analytics or Artificial Intelligence or any party as per agreed upon.
